# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

## Test suite added

* RSS Feeds
 * are defined
 * has a URL property defined and that the URL is not empty in each feed
 * has a name property defined and that the name is not empty in each feed
* The menu
 * is hidden by default
 * changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked
* Initial Entries
 * when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container.
* New Feed Selection
 * when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes.

## How to run

Download repository to your computer and open it in your browser. Open file index.html in browser. The test results will be displayed at the bottom of the page.
